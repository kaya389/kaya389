This summer I finally defined my field of work. 
Before that, I was interested in games, Unity, C#... 
Then I decided I needed to be a full-stack developer. 
I needed to be a team leader on my own and showcase my creativity across every aspect of a project. 

As of December 31, 2025,
I believe I have sufficiently developed my skills in JavaScript, specifically in DOM manipulation & event handling, object-oriented coding;
for Back-End TypeScript, ASP.NET Core;
in React/React Native, in hooks, lifecycle management, performance optimization, state management, and optimizing applications for mobile or desktop; 
and in animation, in WebGL integration, asset management using three.js library, and CSS animations.
My feeling is that I can bring to life a web application with the functionality and appearance requested, incorporating my individual creativity and using the right implementation method and secure, fast, proper working backends.

You can see that I didn't move away from game development in the projects I've done with vanilla JS and React. I also want to implement my projects using Unity.

My next exciting idea to me is to make my Live Order System a real SaaS project.
Also I want to use these technologies to bring my own theater and film scripts to life as short versions and share them on social media.
I like the "cinematic" perspective of this job much.
