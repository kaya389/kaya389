This summer I finally defined my field of work. 
Before that, I was interested in games, Unity, C#... 
Then I decided I needed to be a full-stack developer. 
I needed to be a team leader on my own and showcase my creativity across every aspect of a project. 
But as I said, I was at the starting point; I knew a little CSS and HTML from university classes.

As of December 31, 2025,
I believe I have sufficiently developed my skills in JavaScript, specifically in DOM manipulation & event handling, and object-oriented coding;
in React, in hooks, lifecycle management, performance optimization, and state management; 
and in animation, in WebGL integration, asset management using three.js library, and CSS animations.
My feeling is that I can bring to life a web application with the functionality and appearance requested, incorporating my individual creativity and using the right implementation method.

You can see that I didn't move away from game development in the projects I've done with vanilla JS and React. I also want to implement my projects using Unity.

My next exciting idea to me is to use these technologies to bring my own theater and film scripts to life as short versions and share them on social media.
I like the "cinematic" perspective of this job much.

Also, while I acknowledge it's still incomplete, I believe I've passed the front-end development stage and am now working on learning back-end development and creating projects.
